CSS as XML attributes

See the XML Prague 2013 [slides](http://publishinggeekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/xmlprague/CSSa_xmlprague_gimsieke.html#/step-1) 

See also [Hub XML](https://github.com/gimsieke/Hub), a DocBook 5.1 derivative that allows for documents that lack a proper section hierarchy and uses CSSa for expressing layout information. 
It is used as a common intermediate format to represent raw conversion results of, for example, OOXML, ODT, and IDML documents.
